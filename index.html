<p>Currently, I hosted my blog on github.io, and try to write something.</p>
<p>Programming is hard, compiling is not easy, while I am still working in my domain, persist to achieve, not even make a change.</p>
<p>That is who I am.</p>
<p>If you want to contact me, please send an email via cosh dot cage at hotmail dot com:</P>
